# Foundry

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

[Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).

[Cast](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.

[Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/anvil): Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.

[Chisel](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
​

## Get Started with Foundry

1. Install Foundry

- Linux or MaxOS

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

- Windows

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry foundry-cli anvil --bins --locked
```

2. Create a project

```bash
forge init foundry
```

3. Navigate to the Source in the project and create your smart contract

```bash
cd src
touch MyToken.sol
```

4. Input your smart contract or use the sample contract below.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public greet = "Hello World!";
}
```

5. Install OpenZeppelin contracts as a dependency

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

6. Compile contract

```bash
forge build
```

## Deploying Your Smart Contract

Deploying a contract with Forge is a simple process that can be done with a single command. However, it requires an RPC endpoint, a private key that has funds, and any arguments for the constructor of the contract.

For example, the `MyToken.sol` contract requires an initial supply of tokens to be specified in its constructor, so the command to deploy it on a network will include the argument of 100.

To deploy the `MyToken.sol` contract, use the command that corresponds to the Mint chain’s RPC URL while running the `forge create` command:

### Testnet

```bash
forge create --rpc-url "https://rpc.mintchain.io"
--constructor-args 100 \
--private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
src/MyToken.sol:MyToken
```
