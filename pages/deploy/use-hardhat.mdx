# Using Hardhat with Mint

To configure [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to deploy smart contracts to Mint, update your projectâ€™s `hardhat.config.ts` file by adding Mint as a network:

```typescript
networks: {
    // for mainnet
   "mint-mainnet": {
     url: "Coming Soon",
     accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
     gasPrice: 1000000000,
   },
   // for Sepolia testnet
   "mint-sepolia": {
     url: "https://testnet-rpc.mintchain.io",
     accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string]
     gasPrice: 1000000000,
   },
   // for local dev environment
   "mint-local": {
     url: "http://localhost:8545",
     accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
     gasPrice: 1000000000,
   },
 },
 defaultNetwork: "mint-local",
```
