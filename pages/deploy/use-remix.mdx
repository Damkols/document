## Testnet

In case you haven't added Mint Network to your wallet yet, click on the icon next to the <img style={{display: 'inline-block'}} src="/assets/remix-env.jpg" alt="Remix button" /> label. This will take you to Chainlist's website where you can look up Mint Mainnet and Testnet settings and add them to your wallet.
