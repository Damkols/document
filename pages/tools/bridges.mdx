The bridge of Mint Testnet can bridge Sepolia Testnet ETH to Mint Testnet and vice versa.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that when you withdraw Sepolia ETH from Mint Testnet to Sepolia Testnet,
  it will take about seven days (challenge period) to receive your Sepolia ETH
  on Sepolia Testnet, as Mint Blockchain is built on OP Stack.
