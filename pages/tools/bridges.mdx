import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that when you withdraw Sepolia ETH from Mint Testnet to Sepolia Testnet,
  you have to wait for within 30 minutes, and then prove and finalize your withdrawal 
  on Sepolia Testnet to receive your Sepolia ETH, as Mint Blockchain is built on OP Stack.
