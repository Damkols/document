Multisig wallets are wallets that allow multiple parties to control and secure assets, reducing the risk of fraud and unauthorized access. To approve transactions you usually need more than one signer and this creates an extra layer of security in case one of the private keys gets compromised.

Mint Blockchain has integrated Superchain Safe as our official multisig wallets provider.
