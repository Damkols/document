## How do network fees on Mint work?

Every Mint transaction consists of two costs: an L2 (execution) fee and an L1 (security) fee. The L2 fee is the cost to execute your transaction on the L2, and the L1 fee is the estimated cost to publish the transaction on the L1. Typically, the L1 security fee is higher than the L2 execution fee.

In advance, Mint Blockchain uses Celestia as the DA (Data Availability) layer to lower gas fees for users. Celestia employs cutting-edge data availability sampling techniques—two-dimensional Reed-Solomon coding and Namespaced Merkle Trees (NMTs)—to address L2 data availability concerns in a trust-minimized manner. By using Celestia, Mint Blockchain can significantly reduce transaction costs for users.
